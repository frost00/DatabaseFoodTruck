# DatabaseFoodTruck
This project demonstrates the Agile development framework. I have created everything from the conceptual schema to the logical schema and physical schema. Some file are not going to open becasue the file size is large to due the file being a picture rather than a pdf.
I am working on getting software for designing Entity Relationship Diagrams. At this point in time I either draw the ERD's by hand or use free software online when available.

Feel free to clone the repository and run the scriptsv2.1 sql files. I have examples of create scripts, and more. You can open up the files and read the comments which describe what each file does.

Order in which to run the files:

1) Create.sql
2) baseData.sql
3) describe.sql
4) drop.sql

I look forward to recieving comments regarding the sql files and ERD's. This project will be used for a food truck business in the future. For the backend services I will be using springboot and java for the connection to the PostgreSQL database. Thank you in advance for your review and comments.
